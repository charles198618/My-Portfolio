## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to create my first porfolio since it's mandatory to have a porfolio with my personal information. Thus, the potential employer may reach out to me to offer me a job. Moreover, the reason that pushed to me to do this project is Knowledge. I wanted to learn new skils that may help me to find a job in web development.

## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to mention is Bootstrap. It is a website that has pre-written code that can be used to create websites.
## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The big obstacle was how to use the Bootstrap to satisfies my vision. Also, the use of CSS was one the challenges.
